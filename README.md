# CMPT 419 - FINAL PROJECT
 
The structure of the code consists of google collab file that contains 5 different sections. 

* Section 1: Extracting Facial Social Signals with OpenFace
* Section 2: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
* Section 3: Classifer Selection
* Section 4: Hyper-Parameter Tuning
* Section 5: Final Random Forest Model Training and Evaluation

Each section will give a brief description of what will be happening if the cells are executed but keep in mind that running sections such as hyper parameter tuning could take around 3 hours to run.

For the most part, our group completed all of the tasks that was stated in the proposal from the data collection, to training a Random Forest, to evaluation. Some differences are that we also performed Hyper-parameter tuning as well as used precision and accuracy scores as our main metric.

There is a cell where OpenFace must be installed to process any of the videos
